\title{Check if a file is binary}
\usage{
is_binary_file(file_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{Path to the file to check}
}
\value{
Logical indicating if the file appears to be binary. Returns FALSE for
  empty files or if the file cannot be read.
}
\description{
Determines whether a file appears to be binary by examining the first 1024 bytes
for common binary file characteristics. This function is useful for avoiding
attempts to process binary files with text-based functions, which could cause
errors or unexpected behavior.
}
\examples{
# Check if a file is binary
is_binary <- is_binary_file("data.csv")
if (is_binary) {
  cat("File appears to be binary - use appropriate reader\n")
} else {
  cat("File appears to be text-based\n")
}

# Check multiple files
files <- c("text.txt", "image.png", "data.csv")
binary_status <- sapply(files, is_binary_file)
print(binary_status)

}
