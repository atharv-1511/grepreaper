\title{Safe system call that handles errors gracefully}
\usage{
safe_system_call(cmd, timeout = 60)
}
\arguments{
\item{cmd}{Command to execute (typically built with \code{build_grep_cmd})}

\item{timeout}{Timeout in seconds (default: 60) - Note: not used in Windows}
}
\value{
Result of system call as a character vector, or empty character vector
  on error or timeout
}
\description{
Executes system commands with comprehensive error handling and cross-platform
compatibility. This function automatically detects and uses the appropriate grep
implementation on Windows (Git for Windows or WSL) and provides timeout handling
on Unix-like systems. It's designed to work seamlessly with the grep-related
functions in this package.
}
\examples{
# Execute a simple command
result <- safe_system_call("echo 'Hello World'")
print(result)

# Execute grep command
cmd <- build_grep_cmd("error", "log.txt")
result <- safe_system_call(cmd)
print(result)

# With timeout (Unix-like systems only)
result_timeout <- safe_system_call(cmd, timeout = 30)
print(result_timeout)
