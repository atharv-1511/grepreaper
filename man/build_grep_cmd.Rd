\title{Build grep command string}
\usage{
build_grep_cmd(pattern, files, options = "", fixed = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pattern}{Pattern to search for (will be automatically quoted)}

\item{files}{Files to search in (can be a single file or vector of files)}

\item{options}{Options string for grep (e.g., "-i" for case-insensitive)}

\item{fixed}{Logical; if TRUE, pattern is treated as a literal string (not escaped)}
}
\value{
A properly formatted command string ready for system execution
}
\description{
Constructs a safe and properly formatted grep command string for system execution.
This function handles input sanitization to prevent command injection and ensures
proper quoting of patterns and file paths. It's designed to work with the
\code{safe_system_call} function for secure command execution.
}
\examples{
# Basic grep command
cmd <- build_grep_cmd("error", "log.txt")
print(cmd)

# With grep options
cmd_verbose <- build_grep_cmd("warning", "*.log", options = "-i -n")
print(cmd_verbose)

# Multiple files
cmd_multi <- build_grep_cmd("ERROR", c("file1.txt", "file2.txt"))
print(cmd_multi)

# Fixed string matching (literal search)
cmd_fixed <- build_grep_cmd("3.14", "data.csv", fixed = TRUE)
print(cmd_fixed)
}
