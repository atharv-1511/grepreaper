## 🌐 How to Use Cross-Device Testing

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Environment**
```r
# Ensure R 4.0.0+ is installed
# Install required package
install.packages("data.table")
```

### **Step 2: Copy Required Files**
- Copy `R/grep_read.r` (refactored function)
- Copy `R/utils.r` (helper functions)
- Copy `test_portable.R` (test script)

### **Step 3: Update File Paths**
Edit the configuration section in `test_portable.R`:

```r
# Windows paths
test_files <- c(
  "C:\\Your\\Path\\To\\diamonds.csv",
  "C:\\Your\\Path\\To\\your_dataset.csv"
)

# macOS/Linux paths
test_files <- c(
  "/Users/username/path/to/diamonds.csv",
  "/Users/username/path/to/your_dataset.csv"
)
```

### **Step 4: Run the Test**
```bash
# From command line
Rscript test_portable.R

# Or from R console
source("test_portable.R")
```
