# Comprehensive grepreaper Package Testing Guide

## 🎯 Overview

This guide provides comprehensive testing instructions for the `grepreaper` R package, covering all scenarios and addressing all mentor feedback issues. The testing is designed to run on another device for cross-verification.

## 📁 Files Required

1. **`comprehensive_package_test_final.R`** - Main comprehensive testing script
2. **`install_grepreaper_simple.R`** - Backup installation script
3. **`COMPREHENSIVE_TESTING_GUIDE.md`** - This guide

## 🗂️ Required Datasets

The testing script expects the following datasets in your Downloads folder:

```
C:\Users\Atharv Raskar\Downloads\diamonds.csv
C:\Users\Atharv Raskar\Downloads\Amusement_Parks_Rides_Registered.csv
C:\Users\Atharv Raskar\Downloads\academic Stress level - maintainance 1.csv
C:\Users\Atharv Raskar\Downloads\pima-indians-diabetes.csv
```

**Note**: If some datasets are missing, the script will skip those tests automatically.

## 🚀 Installation and Testing Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

1. **Open R or RStudio** on the target device
2. **Ensure you have internet access** for GitHub package installation
3. **Copy the testing files** to your working directory

### Step 2: Install the Package

**Option A: Use the comprehensive script (recommended)**
```r
source('comprehensive_package_test_final.R')
```

**Option B: Use the simple installation script**
```r
source('install_grepreaper_simple.R')
```

### Step 3: Run Comprehensive Testing

If you used Option B for installation, run the comprehensive testing:
```r
source('comprehensive_package_test_final.R')
```

## 🧪 What the Testing Covers

### Core Functionality Tests
- ✅ Basic pattern matching
- ✅ Fixed string search (`fixed=TRUE`)
- ✅ Regex search (`fixed=FALSE`)
- ✅ Case sensitive/insensitive search
- ✅ Word boundary matching
- ✅ Inverted search
- ✅ Only matching parts

### Mentor Feedback Issues Tests
- ✅ **Issue 1**: Fixed string search (`fixed=TRUE`) - Working correctly
- ✅ **Issue 2**: Regex search (`fixed=FALSE`) - Working correctly
- ✅ **Issue 3**: Column splitting with multiple files - No filename, no line numbers
- ✅ **Issue 4**: Line number recording - Actual source file lines vs sequential rows
- ✅ **Issue 5**: Count-only with multiple files - Proper column structure
- ✅ **Issue 6**: `include_filename=FALSE` - Correctly removes filename column
- ✅ **Issue 7**: No double data output - Clean, single data output
- ✅ **Issue 8**: Proper `-H` flag handling - Only added when needed
- ✅ **Issue 9**: Windows path handling - Working correctly

### Advanced Scenarios Tests
- ✅ Empty pattern (read entire file)
- ✅ Multiple file handling with different structures
- ✅ Large file handling with row limits
- ✅ Edge cases and error handling

### Cross-Dataset Tests
- ✅ Diamonds dataset functionality
- ✅ Amusement Parks dataset functionality
- ✅ Academic Stress dataset functionality
- ✅ Diabetes dataset functionality

## 📊 Expected Test Results

### All Tests Should Show:
- ✅ **PASSED** for functionality tests
- ✅ **PASSED** for mentor feedback issue tests
- ✅ **PASSED** for advanced scenario tests
- ✅ **PASSED** for cross-dataset tests

### If Any Test Shows:
- ❌ **FAILED** - The specific issue needs attention
- ⚠️ **WARNING** - Test was skipped due to missing dataset
- 💥 **ERROR** - Unexpected error occurred

## 🔍 Key Verification Points

### 1. Fixed String Search
```r
# This should work and find rows
result <- grep_read(files = "diamonds.csv", pattern = "VVS1", fixed = TRUE)
```

### 2. Column Splitting with Multiple Files
```r
# Should combine columns from multiple files without duplicates
result <- grep_read(files = c("file1.csv", "file2.csv"), 
                   pattern = "", 
                   show_line_numbers = FALSE, 
                   include_filename = FALSE)
```

### 3. Line Number Recording
```r
# Should show actual source file line numbers, not sequential 1,2,3...
result <- grep_read(files = "diamonds.csv", 
                   pattern = "VVS1", 
                   show_line_numbers = TRUE)
```

### 4. Count-Only with Multiple Files
```r
# Should return proper count structure for each file
result <- grep_read(files = c("file1.csv", "file2.csv"), 
                   pattern = "test", 
                   count_only = TRUE)
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues
- **Rtools required**: Install Rtools 4.3 for R 4.3.x
- **Network issues**: Check internet connection and firewall settings
- **Permission issues**: Run R as administrator if needed

### Dataset Issues
- **Missing files**: Script will automatically skip tests for missing datasets
- **Path issues**: Ensure file paths match exactly (case-sensitive)
- **File corruption**: Re-download datasets if they appear corrupted

### Package Issues
- **Load errors**: Try restarting R session
- **Version conflicts**: Remove and reinstall the package
- **Function not found**: Ensure package is properly loaded

## 📈 Performance Expectations

- **Installation**: 2-5 minutes (depending on internet speed)
- **Testing**: 5-10 minutes (depending on dataset sizes)
- **Memory usage**: Minimal (datasets are processed efficiently)
- **CPU usage**: Low to moderate during testing

## 🎉 Success Criteria

The testing is considered **successful** when:

1. ✅ Package installs without errors
2. ✅ Package loads without warnings
3. ✅ All core functionality tests pass
4. ✅ All mentor feedback issue tests pass
5. ✅ All advanced scenario tests pass
6. ✅ All available cross-dataset tests pass
7. ✅ No unexpected errors occur
